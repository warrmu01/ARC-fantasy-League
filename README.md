# Fantasy Soccer League Project

## Currently in the process in moving the backend from Flask to Spring Boot! Stay Tuned.

## Overview

This project involves the development of a fantasy soccer league application. The primary focus areas include creating a visually appealing user interface (UI) using Tailwind CSS, building a robust backend with SQLAlchemy for database management, and implementing RESTful API integration for player data.

## Features

- **User Interface (UI):**
  - Designed and developed a visually appealing and consistent UI for the fantasy soccer league application using Tailwind CSS.
  - Collaborated effectively in a team of two to ensure the UI meets both aesthetic and functional requirements.

- **Database Management:**
  - Structured a robust database using SQLAlchemy with three related tables/collections.
  - Implemented advanced join queries to enhance data retrieval efficiency.
  - Ensured reliable validation and error handling mechanisms for data input and operations.

- **Backend Development:**
  - Engineered comprehensive programming logic for handling HTTP requests (GET and POST methods).
  - Incorporated robust error handling strategies to validate and sanitize user inputs, ensuring data integrity.
  
- **API Integration:**
  - Developed and deployed an API for fetching player data relevant to the fantasy league.
  - Successfully integrated API endpoints to fetch and display real-time player statistics and information within the application.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), Javascript

- **Backend:**
  - Python (Flask framework for RESTful API)
  - SQLAlchemy for database management

- **APIs:**
  - Integrated third-party APIs for fetching player data
